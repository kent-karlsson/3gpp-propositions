#	Name:             3GPP 23.038 Unicode (UCS) to Unicode for SMS/CBS
#	Unicode version:  16.0 and later
#	Table version:    1.0
#	Table format:     Format A
#	Date:             2025 July 04
#	Authors:          Kent Karlsson
#
#	General notes:
#
#	This mapping is based on 3GPP TS 23.038 V18.0.0 (2022-09), "3rd Generation
#	Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Core Network and
#	Terminals; Alphabets and language-specific information (Release 18)".
#
#	This is a "Unicode to Unicode mapping", and most characters are not
#	listed explicitly, but instead rely on @missing directive, mostly
#	mapping to itself.
#
#	This table is intended for SMS and CBS only, do not use it for any
#	other context. Note that there must be no "byte order mark" (ZWNBSP,
#	0xFEFF), but the bytes are in "network byte order". Most C0/C1
#	characters are unexpected in SMS/CBS, except for LF and CR (filler
#	in SMS/CBS) so we map most of them to REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, LF or SP
#	as appropriate, though CRs are normally to be removed.
#
#	The submessages that constitute a message can each have different
#	character encodings. 1) Convert to UTF-16 (in processor endianness),
#	2) remove filler CRs. Concatenate, or assembing into a list, in proper
#	order, the submessages. Note that there is an order number, in TCP/IP,
#	along with a total number, in the submessages so they (their text
#	content) can be concatenated or assembled in proper order.
#
#	Note that CARRIAGE RETURN is used as terminator/filler when needed.
#
#	Format:  Three tab-separated columns
#		 Column #1 is the Unicode scalar value as 0xXXXX or a
#                  range 0xXXXX..0xXXXX.
#		 Column #2 is the Unicode scalar value (in hex as 0xXXXX)
#		 Column #3 the Unicode name (follows a comment sign, '#')

0x0000	0xFFFD	#	mapped to repl. char (note that this code is not terminator/filler in SMS/CBS, instead CR is used as filler)
0x0001..0x0003	0x000A	#	SOH..ETX mapped to LF (these are ("special") paragraph separators)
