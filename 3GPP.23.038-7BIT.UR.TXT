#	Name:             3GPP 23.038 7-bit for Urdu (Eastern Arabic alphabet) (0x13) to Unicode
#	Unicode version:  17.0.0
#	Table version:    1.0
#	Table format:     Format A
#	Date:             2025 December 21
#	Authors:          Kent Karlsson
#
#	General notes:
#
#	This mapping is based on 3GPP TS 23.038 V18.0.0 (2022-09), "3rd Generation
#	Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Core Network and
#	Terminals; Alphabets and language-specific information (Release 18)".
#	Language code (Table 6.2.1.2.4.1) 0x13. Corrected and extended.
#
#	This 7-bit encoding (and mapping) should only be used in the context of
#	SMS/CBS (including processing of such messages).
#
#	An SS2 character (0x1B) that is not part of a mapped SS2 sequence
#	should be mapped to REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, to indicate the encoding
#	error. See the @missing declarations below. (3GPP 03.038 specifies
#	mapping SS2 alone to SPACE, but that is not generally helpful.)
#
#	0x0D is CR which is used as filler after the actual message text,
#	and in case of 2-letter (always in original default 7-bit encoding)
#	language code prefix (a language tagging method available only for
#	the CBS protocol), also between the language code and actual message.
#	These CR characters are to be inserted (when converting to an
#	SMS/CBS encoding, also the UTF-16BE encoding as used for SMS/CBS)
#	or removed (when converting from an SMS/CBS encoding). A CR 
#	occurring strictly INSIDE of a message (should not happen...)
#	should be converted to LF. This handling of CR is not reflected
#	in the table below, which just maps CR to CR.
#
#	Note that 0x00 is the code for ARABIC LETTER ALEF. It is never used as
#	filler or terminator.
#
#	The characters here are mostly Arabic letters (+ "Latin" letters
#	and digits), thus for displaying messages in this encoding one
#	must apply both the bidi algorithm and Arabic shaping (preshaped
#	Arabic letters are not encoded). The "paragraph level" parameter
#	is always "LTR" for SMS/CBS messages. The bidi  algoritnm is applied
#	*after* submessage concatenation. LRM and RLM can be used to "fix"
#	bidi ordering issues for 'bidi neutral' symbols, like quote marks,
#	comma, full stop, ... in case of 'order change' around the symbol.
#
#	Format:  Three tab-separated columns
#		 Column #1 is the 3GPP TS 23.038 7-bit Urdu alphabet (0x13) code
#                  (in hex as 0xXX or 0x1BXX (SS2))
#		 Column #2 is the (or a sequence of) Unicode scalar value (in hex as 0xXXXX)
#		 Column #3 the Unicode name (follows a comment sign, '#') plus comments
#
#	The entries are in 3GPP TS 23.038 7-bit Urdu alphabet code order.

### Bidi AL to be handled as bidi R, except arabic punctuation which is to be handled as ON; 
### all bidi EN and AN to be handled as L; all ET, ES, CS to be handled as ON for SMS/CBS.
### 'Paragraph direction' is always LTR for SMS/CBS. There are no nestable bidi controls in SMS/CBS.
### Bidi mirroring applies; however, bidi mirroring does not apply to arrows, even though arrows most often
### refer to the adjacent text components, and not external directions; it is up to the author to mirror arrows.




ظ (Ẓāʾ) 0638: This is considered the rarest letter in Arabic, and consequently very rare in Urdu. In 
  Urdu, it is pronounced the same as zay (ز), zal (ذ), and zvad (ض), and is only found in specific 
  Arabic loanwords.
ض (Ḍād) 0636: Similar to Ẓāʾ, this letter represents a distinct emphatic sound in Arabic but is 
  pronounced exactly like zay (ز) in Urdu. It is restricted to Arabic loanwords.
ث (Ṡe) 062B: This letter is common in Arabic (pronounced as a soft 'th'). In Urdu, it is pronounced 
  as a simple 's' (س) and is used only in borrowed vocabulary.
ح (Ḥe) 062D: While used in Urdu, it is often pronounced identically to the common 'h' (ہ) in everyday 
  Urdu, despite being a distinct guttural sound in Arabic.
ذ (Ẕāl) 0630: Pronounced as a hard 'th' in Arabic, it is pronounced as 'z' (ز) in Urdu and is mostly 
  limited to Arabic loanwords.
ة (Tāʾ marbūṭah) --: This is common in Arabic for feminine nouns but is almost never used in native 
  Urdu words, usually replaced by the Hae (ہ) or Tae (ت) sound in Urdu spelling, or dropped.
ع ('Ain) 0639: While used in Urdu, it is often used as a vowel placeholder (similar to Alif) and its 
  distinct Arabic pharyngeal sound is rarely pronounced by native Urdu speakers. 



Here are the main letters/forms used in Arabic but largely absent or rarely used in Urdu:

ة (Tāʾ marbūṭah) --: This is very common in Arabic to mark feminine nouns (e.g., مدرسة - madrasah). 
  In Urdu, these words are almost always spelled with a final ہ (chhotī he) or ت (tē) instead 
  (e.g., مدرسہ - madrasah).
ال (Alif-Lam): The Arabic definite article "the" (ال) is used in some loanwords but is 
  not used grammatically in Urdu.
  
Emphatic Consonants 
(ص,0635
 ض,0636
 ط,0637
 ظ): 0638
 While these letters exist in the Urdu alphabet, they are 
used primarily in Arabic loanwords and are not native to Urdu phonology. In many cases, their 
unique Arabic pronunciation is lost, and they are pronounced similarly to other letters 
(e.g., ص is  0635   often pronounced like sīn/س).0633

Letter 0636 ḍād (ض):  Often regarded as one of the hardest Arabic letters to replicate, it
is extremely rare to find it used correctly in non-religious, everyday Urdu vocabulary.

Interdental Fricatives 062B
(ث,    
ذ): These 0630 are also typically restricted to Arabic loanwords 
and are rarely used in native, everyday Urdu words, often replaced by sīn/س and zay/ز 
respectively in popular usage. 

Important Context:
Urdu actually includes letters that Arabic does not have, 
such as پ (pe 067E), چ (che 0686), گ (gaf 06AF), and ڑ (rha 0691), 
 due to its Persian and Indo-Aryan influence.
 
Urdu uses the Nastaʿlīq script, which is a different, more cursive handwriting style 
than the Naskh script typically used for Arabic.
The letter ژ (zhe) exists in Urdu and Persian, but is not used in Arabic. 
Therefore, the letters that are distinctly "Arabic only" (or used only in 
religious/high-register loanwords in Urdu) are primarily ة and the specialized 
emphatic consonants. 




All three use related writing systems… but the pronounce a lot of letters differently. e.g. In 
Urdu س ص ث all sound pretty much the same, but they are different in Arabic. Persian has some 
extra letters: پ p چ ch ژ zh [i think] Urdu has these plus a few extras ٹ T ڈ D ڑ R and ں “nasal 
vowel”, Arabic and Persian also have T D R but Urdu has two slightly different types of each. A 
couple of other Arabic letters have diverged in Urdu ـهـ to ـہـ ـھـ and ي to ی ے but they are a 
bit more complicated to explain. Two letters tend to be written a bit differently in Arabic ك ي to 
how they are in Persian and Urdu ک ی (enough that they gave then separate unicode characters), but 
i think the difference is just in appearance, and some dialects of Arabic also often leave the 
dots off ي in the same situations as Urdu and Persian e.g. in مصری (Egyptian Arabic).
